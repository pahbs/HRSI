class ConvertToWRS:
    """Class which performs conversion between latitude/longitude co-ordinates
    and Landsat WRS-2 paths and rows.
    Requirements:
    * OGR (in the GDAL suite)
    * Shapely
    * Landsat WRS-2 Path/Row Shapefiles - download from USGS site
     (http://landsat.usgs.gov/tools_wrs-2_shapefile.php), you want wrs2_descending.zip
    Usage:
    1. Create an instance of the class:

        conv = ConvertToWRS()
    (This will take a while to run, as it loads
    the shapefiles in to memory)
    2. Use the get_wrs method to do a conversion:
        print conv.get_wrs(50.14, -1.43)
    For example:
        >>> conv = ConvertToWRS()
        >>> conv.get_wrs(50.14, -1.7)
        [{'path': 202, 'row': 25}]
        >>> conv.get_wrs(50.14, -1.43)
        [{'path': 201, 'row': 25}, {'path': 202, 'row': 25}]
